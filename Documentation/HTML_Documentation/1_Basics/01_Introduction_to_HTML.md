## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document is made up of elements enclosed in tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
